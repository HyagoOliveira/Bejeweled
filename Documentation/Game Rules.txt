Um jogo de Match 3 consiste de uma matriz de nodes com dimenções W x H.

1. Nodes: o item que sofrerá o matching. A gema do jogo.
2. Tiles: o local onde os nodes ficam. In a matrix of W x H, each tile is representable by a number from 0 to (W - 1 x H - 1).
3. Matches: The matching of M until the directional size (generally 3 for match 3 games):
    3.1. M until (W - 1) for horizontal maches;
    3.2. M until (H - 1) for vertical matches;
4. No diagonal matches are allowed.

How to detect matches

1. Every match (vertical or horizontal) is detected at the node located at the smallest nth of tile.
2. To detect the vertical matches, we only need to scan the nodes which are from the row 0th to (W - X).
3. To detect the horizontal matches, we only need to scan the nodes which are from the column 0th to 5th.

for(y = 0 to H - X)
{
    for(x = 0 to W - X)
    {
        isHorizontalMatch = node[x, y] == node[x + 1 ,y] == node[x + 2 ,y] .. until X
        isVerticalMatch = node[x, y] == node[x, y + 1] == node[x, y + 2] .. until X
    }
}
